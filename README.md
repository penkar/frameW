# FrameW
### This is basically the same project as [NotTheWashingtonPost](https://github.com/penkar/notwashingtonpost)
#### Loose clone of the Wapo and NYT websites built without React, Redux or any major rendering library. Currently there is no method to rerender the page, it will just render the static home page and nothine else. Listeners for location changes still need to be added.
